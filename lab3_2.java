/*Instructions: Given the cylinderRadius, piValue, and cylinderHeight, compute
                the volume of a cylinder and assign cylinderRadius and cylinderHeight
                with the result. Use Scanner to obtain the radius and height values.
            **Volume of a cylinder = Ï€*(r^2)*h
Print out the cylinder's volume using cylinderVolume in the following format:
"The volume of a cylinder with a radius of ______ and a height of _______ is ___________."
